# Groningen Apartment Hunter Bot

This Python bot helps you find your perfect apartment in Groningen. It continuously checks various apartment rental websites, looking for new listings that match your preferences. Whenever it finds a potential match, the bot sends a notification to your Telegram account. (Yes I did find the place I'm living today using this bot ðŸ˜œ)

## Features

- Monitors several apartment rental websites, including Pararius, Kamernet, 123Wonen, and more.
- Periodically refreshes the pages to find new listings.
- Sends Telegram notifications for new apartments that match your preferences.
- Uses threading for efficient resource usage, with one thread running the Telegram bot and another managing the apartment-hunting process.

## Getting the bot to work

### Create a Telegram bot
On Telegram, search for "BotFather"
Send him the message
```
/newbot
```
Follow the BotFather steps!

When you are done, he should tell you the HTTP API token, we'll need this later.

### Windows setup
We will install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Open the "Windows PowerShell" and run the following command:

```
wsl --install
```

Restart the computer and open the Ubuntu program. You can now follow the Ubuntu setup.

### Ubuntu setup
If you don't have docker installed, install docker.
```
sudo snap install docker
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
newgrp docker
sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock
```

Then, clone the repository and build the Groningen Hunter.

```
git clone https://github.com/brenocq/groningen-hunter.git
cd groningen-hunter
./hunter.sh --build
```

### Running the bot
Before running the bot, we need to set the Telegram HTTP API token (the one you got from the BotFather)

```
./hunter.sh --set-bot-token "YOUR-TELEGRAM-BOT-TOKEN"
./hunter.sh --run
```

The bot is now running, but we need to get the Chat ID to be able to receive the apartment notifications in our Telegram chat. Send the following message to your bot on Telegram.

```
/chatid
```

The bot should answer you with the Chat ID, set the hunter Chat ID.

```
./hunter.sh --set-chat-id "YOUR-CHAT-ID"
```

It is also possible to configure the maximum and minimum prices to filter the apartments with the `--set-min` and `--set-max` commands. For example:

```
./hunter.sh --set-max 1000
./hunter.sh --set-min 300
```

All set up! You can now leave the bot running and wait for the notifications :)

```
./hunter.sh --run
```

If you implement new hunters or develop new features, please create a PR. If you find any bugs, please open a new issue. All help is welcome ;)
